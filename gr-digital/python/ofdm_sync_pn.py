  OFDM synchronization using pseudo-noise correlation.
  T. M. Schmidl and D. C. Cox, "Robust Frequency and Timing
  Synchonization for OFDM," IEEE Trans. Communications, vol. 45,
  no. 12, 1997.

  Assumes that the signal preamble is two identical copies of pseudo-noise
  half-symbols. Equivalently in frequency domain, the odd freqencies are 0.

  The two half-symbols are expected to be offset by pi T deltaf.
  This method can detect the timing and the frequency offset but only within
  +- 1/T.

  Let L = T/2
  P(d) = sum_{i=1..L} x[d+i] x[d+i+L]*
  R(d) = sum_{i=1..L} |x[d+i+L]|^2
  M(d) = |P(d)|^2/R(d)^2
  d_opt = argmax_d M(d)
  timing_start := d_opt
  fine_freq := angle(P(d_opt)) / (2 pi L)

  Observe: angle(P(d_opt)) is in [-pi, pi]
    Therefore max CFO that can be detected is 1/(2L) * fft_len

  outputs:
    Output 0: delayed signal
    Output 1: fine frequency correction value (to drive NCO)
    Output 2: timing signal (indicates first sample of preamble)

  NOTE: This is equivalent to ofdm_sync_pn.py in trunk.
  Edited for readability only.
